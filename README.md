🚀 Innovation lives in the spirit of lazy

It’s literally in the name.

🤔 What Is This?

You paste the essentials.
It gives you beautiful, ready-to-use wikitext.

💾 Auto-save – never lose your progress

✏️ Annotation Tool – play around with your images

📄 Wikitext Generator – structured headings, code blocks, and steps

👀 Live Preview – see your guide in action

📥 Download – as .txt or .zip (ZIP includes images!)

🔄 Drag & Drop – reorder steps effortlessly

🛠️ What It Does

Generates structured installation guides

Formats proper headings, sections, and code blocks

Turns messy notes into clean wiki-ready text

Makes you feel organized (mostly)

❌ What It Does NOT Do

Install your software for you

Fix your broken dependencies

Explain why it’s not working for you

Replace common sense

We generate documentation.
Miracles are in church.

🧘 Philosophy

If you have to do something more than twice, automate it.
If automation takes longer than the task... do it anyway.


🎉 Credits

Special thanks to my junior devs:

Gemini – occasionally overconfident, frequently helpful

Claude – structured, thoughtful, has a weird tendency to… well, you’ll see 😏

Together, they transformed:

“I need to write docs…”
into
“Hold on, let me generate that.”

If you’re still writing installation guides manually…
That’s brave. 💪
